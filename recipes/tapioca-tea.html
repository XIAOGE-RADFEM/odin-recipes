    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    A Tapioca Tea, also known as bubble tea, is a popular beverage from East
    Asian countries. It is essentially milk tea with little balls made from
    cassava flour. Although tapioca teas are very delicious, the high sugar
    content makes some warn about its "health implications".
    <h2>What you need</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Whole-fat milk</li>
      <li>Tea bag, or loose-leaf tea</li>
      <li>Tapioca balls</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make</h2>
    <h3>Milk Tea</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Put the tea bag or tea leaves into a pan of water</li>
      <li>Take the water to boil and leave it to simmer for 11 minutes</li>
      <li>
        Taste the tea liquid and make sure it is bitter as your life, if not,
        add more tea
      </li>
      <li>
        Filter out the tea leaves, or simply take out the tea bags if you've
        been clever, and add milk to the tea soup at a 1:1 ratio.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tapioca Bubbles</h3>
    While it is possible to make the bubbles from cassava flour from scratch, I
    strongly recommend you buy ready-made tapioca.
    <ol>
      <li>Boil a pan of water</li>
      <li>Put in as many bubbles as you wish</li>
      <li>
        When the bubbles float up, add a spoonful of cold water to the pan
      </li>
      <li>When the water boils again, spoon or filter the bubbles out</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Final step</h3>
    Add the tapioca bubbles to the milk tea, and Voila! You've made yourself a
    tapioca tea. Enjoy!

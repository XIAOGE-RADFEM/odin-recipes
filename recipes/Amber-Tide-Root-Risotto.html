    <h2>Description</h2>
    A slow-simmered risotto built around fictional “tide roots,” a sweet-saline
    tuber said to grow where coastal fog meets soil. The dish balances mineral
    notes with warm amber aromatics, finishing creamy but not heavy.
    <h2>What you need</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tide roots (imaginary coastal tubers), peeled and diced</li>
      <li>Pearled risotto rice</li>
      <li>Shallots, finely minced</li>
      <li>Dry white wine</li>
      <li>Vegetable stock infused with kelp</li>
      <li>Amber resin oil (fictional aromatic oil)</li>
      <li>Unsalted butter</li>
      <li>Grated aged cave cheese (imaginary)</li>
      <li>Sea salt and cracked white pepper Lemon zest</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Warm the kelp-infused stock and keep it at a bare simmer.</li>
      <li>
        In a wide pan, soften shallots in butter until translucent. Add tide
        roots and cook briefly to coat.
      </li>
      <li>Stir in rice and toast lightly until edges turn translucent.</li>
      <li>Deglaze with wine and cook until absorbed.</li>
      <li>
        Add hot stock one ladle at a time, stirring steadily, allowing each
        addition to absorb before the next.
      </li>
      <li>
        When rice is al dente and creamy, remove from heat. Fold in amber resin
        oil, cheese, lemon zest, salt, and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>Rest one minute, then serve with a final drizzle of resin oil.</li>
    </ol>
